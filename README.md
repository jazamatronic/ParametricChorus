## Description

<!-- Describe your example here -->
A way of easing myself back into embedded DSP.  
This is meant to be a Parametric Chorus based on that presented by Hal Chamberlin in his Musical Applications of Microprocessors (Second Edition).
He cites the block diagram (Fig. 14-25.) as being taken from notes gathered from a techincal paper delivered by Robert Orban at the 55th convention of the Audio Engineering Society.
I searched low and high for that technical paper but couldn't find it - maybe you can?

This implementation targets the Electro-Smith Daisy Platform on a Pod.
Clone this under the DaisyExamples/pod directory and run make to build

The left input of the line-in is used.
Stereo output is provided.

There are three pages of menu accessible via the encoder. LED1 shows R, G and B respectively.

R = MIX page
  POT1 = Dry/Wet mix
  POT2 = Stereo Spread (Odd vs Even bands panned Ñ•eparately).

G = PHASE page
  Button1 - Phase Noise or Phase Shift mode - LED2 toggles Red when in Phase Noise mode, otherwise it's in Phase Shift mode.
  In Phase Noise mode - (LED2 Red/Purple)
    POT1 = Amount of Noise modulation applied to each band
    POT2 = Per Band BW multiplier
  In Phase Shift mode - (LED2 Off/Blue)
    POT1 = Shift amount (CCW is -ve, 12 o'clock is none, CW is +ve)
    POT2 = Per Band BW multiplier

B = DELAY page
  Button2 - Delay Noise or Delay OSC mode - LED2 toggles Blue when in Delay Noise mode, otherwise it's in Delay Osc mode.
  In Delay Noise mode - (LED2 Blue/Purple)
    POT1 = Amount of Noise modulation applied to each band
    POT2 = Unused
    NOTE: Maybe this needs more work?  Sounds gritty.
  In Delay Osc mode - (LED2 Red/Off)
    POT1 = Delay Mod Rate
    POT2 = Delay Mod Depth
